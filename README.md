# 🎥 Video Classification using CNN (UCF101 Dataset)

This project performs human action recognition on video clips using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) implemented in **TensorFlow**. The **UCF101 dataset** is used for training and evaluation.

---

## 📦 Dataset

The project uses the [UCF101 Dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php), a popular benchmark for human action recognition.  
It contains 13,320 videos across 101 action categories.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Due to large size, the dataset and extracted frames are not included in this repository.

- **OpenCV** – for video frame extraction  
- **Python** – programming language  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for experimentation and documentation  
- **VS Code** – development environment
